# Clock-with-weather-forecaste
This project was part of a lecture "Platform, Sensors and Communication" at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. The task was to build an IoT device in seven weeks. The device shows the current time and the weather forecast of the current day.

The project uses a MakerHawk ESP32 LoRa, NEO-6M GPS module and a 128x64 OLED display. Data is transmitted over The Things Network and a web-service handles requests from the arudion.
